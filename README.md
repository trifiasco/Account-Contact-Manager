# Account-Contact-Manager

This is a very simple web application. It was done as a part of the training I got on basic web application development, when I first join Enosis.

The core technologies used here is `ASP .NET MVC`, `NHibernate`, `Auto-Mapper`. Also maintained design patterns like `Dependency Injection`, `Inversion of Control`etc.
